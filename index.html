					My name is Eliott Greverie, I'm 18 and I'm in my first year of business school at the IESEG School of Management in Lille. I've been passionate about art in all its forms since I was very young.

				<h2>Passionate about drawing ðŸŽ¨ </h2>
				<p>
					I've been passionate about drawing since I was a teenager, and have explored a variety of artistic styles. Quickly driven by the desire to combine art and business, I created an Instagram account to promote myself to a wide audience and sell my drawings. With 2,300 followers, I managed to sign partnerships with well-known brands such as Xp-Pen and Staedtler, for whom I became an ambassador to my community. This experience introduced me to social media communication, the art of negotiation and the dynamic world of commerce at an early age.

				<h3>Passionate about music ðŸŽµ</h3>
				<p>
					I've been exploring different musical genres since I was a kid, including rap, house and techno. Two years ago, I found a new passion and became a DJ. Once again driven by the desire to combine music and business, I've started mixing at more parties by creating a DJ instagram account.
